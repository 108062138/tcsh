Hello,

I am pleased to announce that tcsh-6.24 is now available; this release
provides one new feature:

	1. $'' (dollar-single-quotes or "POSIX quotes")

Text inside the quotes will be interpreted for escapes. Some new escape
sequences are now recognized as well (\c, \x, \u, and \U).

Please consult the Fixes file for a complete list of changes.

Tcsh is an enhanced version of the Berkeley C-shell that offers command
line editing and completion plus many other little things that preserve
the length of your fingers.

Tcsh runs on most UNIX machines, as well as Windows.

You can get tcsh from ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/tcsh/tcsh-6.24.00.tar.gz
The latest source is on github: https://github.com/tcsh-org/tcsh

RMD160 (tcsh-6.24.00.tar.gz) = 0416db03a8b83c91a472fbb51cb4a83db156273c

This is a gzip (GNU zip) tar archive. If you don't have GNU zip you can
get it from ftp.gnu.org or other GNU mirrors.

I would like to thank:

	* everyone who sent bug reports
	* the beta team for all their help, bug fixes, and suggestions

Kind regards,
+ Kimmo
