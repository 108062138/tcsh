Hello,

I am pleased to announce that tcsh-6.23 is now available; this is mainly
a bug fix release (after 2 years) with a couple of new features:

	1. Add "jobs -Z" to setproctitle(3)
	2. Add ln=target in LS_COLORS
	3. Add a :Q modifier that preserves empty arguments

Please consult the Fixes file for a complete list of changes.

Tcsh is an enhanced version of the Berkeley C-shell that offers command
line editing and completion plus many other little things that preserve
the length of your fingers.

Tcsh runs on most UNIX machines, as well as Windows.

You can get tcsh from ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/tcsh/tcsh-6.23.00.tar.gz
The latest source is on github: https://github.com/tcsh-org/tcsh

RMD160 (tcsh-6.23.00.tar.gz) = 956bf3a7cf52f5e4865749d29946cf6e8d512ae3

This is a gzip (GNU zip) tar archive. If you don't have GNU zip you can
get it from ftp.gnu.org or other GNU mirrors.

I would like to thank:

	* everyone who sent bug reports
	* the beta team for all their help, bug fixes, and suggestions

Kind regards,
+ Kimmo
