HOW TO RELEASE TCSH

See TOOLS.md for pre-requisites.

1)  Update version number and date

    - Fixes (make a new entry at the top)
    - configure.ac (TCSH_VERSION and TCSH_DATE)

2)  Run autoreconf

3)  Run make distclean; ./configure && make && make test

4)  If you want to create a new Announce file for the current version,
    you can run

	make Announce

    Edit the new empty file it creates to fill it with content

5)  If checks succeeded, add changed files to git, check the changes,
    commit and tag the release, push to upstream, and create a signed
    archive

	make add
	make diff
	make commit
	make push
	make sign

6)  Make the archive and signature together with some other files
    available on ftp

	make upload
